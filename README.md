# E-commerce-Back-End

## Description
I have built the back end for an e-commerce site. When I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. I then open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, and the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. After I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
